# Comprehensive list and collections of the Block and Allow Lists for AdGuardHome
This is a very comprehensive list of Block and Allow lists for AdGuardHome.
Unfortunately AdGuardHome doesn't allow to add multiple lists at once and hence it is quite tedious and time taking to add multiple lists by hand.
This repo is created for this same purpose where I'm gathering all the block and allow lists from various sources and integrating them in single list format with my own iinclusions/exclusions.
